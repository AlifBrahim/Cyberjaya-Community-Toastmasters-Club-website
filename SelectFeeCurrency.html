<h2>Confidence</h2>

    more you expand your skills and talents, the more confidence you have in yourself!</p>

<p>Self-confidence builds trust in others. People want to listen to someone who is confident in what they have to say
    and how they say it.</p>

<h2>Friendship</h2>

<p>Speech contests are a Toastmasters tradition. Each year, thousands of Toastmasters compete in the Humorous,

    International Speech Contest proceed to the&nbsp;<a

<h2>WANT TO BECOME A BETTER COMMUNICATOR?</h2>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a professional, a student, a stay-at-home parent, or a retiree, Toastmasters is the best way to
    improve your communication skills. Toastmasters can help you lose the fear of public speaking and learn skills that
    will help you be more successful in your chosen endeavor. You&rsquo;ll listen better. You&rsquo;ll more easily lead
    teams and conduct meetings. You&rsquo;ll comfortably give and receive constructive evaluations. You already have
    some or all of these skills. In Toastmasters, you will enhance them.</p>

<p>At Toastmasters, members learn by speaking to and working with, others in a supportive environment. A typical
    Toastmasters club is made up of 20 to 30 people who meet once a week for about an hour and a half. Each meeting
    gives everyone an opportunity to learn and practice the skill of communication.</p>

<h3>Toastmasters learn to conduct meetings.</h3>

<p>Meetings often begin with a short business session which helps members learn the basics of meeting procedures.</p>

<h3>Toastmasters give impromptu speeches.</h3>

<p>Members present 1-2 minute impromptu speeches on assigned topics. This enables the members to have a &lsquo;comeback&rsquo;
    in those sticky situations&rsquo; we often find ourselves in our everyday lives.</p>

<h3>Toastmasters present prepared speeches.</h3>

<p>At a meeting, often two to three members will present speeches based on projects from the Toastmasters International
    Communication and Leadership Program manuals. The skills learned in these often harrowing experiences, cover topics
    such as speech organization, voice, language, gestures, and persuasion.</p>

<p>Evaluation is the foundation that Toastmasters is built on.</p>

<p>Every prepared speaker is assigned an evaluator who points out the speech strengths and offers suggestions for areas
    of improvement.</p>

<h2>WHAT WILL IT DO FOR YOU?</h2>

<p>Most success depends on communication. In business, each employee, whether in management, or a regular &lsquo;Joe&rsquo;,
    faces an endless exchange of ideas, messages, and information as they deal with one another and with customers
    day-to-day. How well they communicate can determine whether a company quickly grows into an industry leader, or
    joins the thousands of businesses mired in mediocrity, or even bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Toastmasters provides the tools that enable us to become effective communicators and leaders, all at a very low
    cost.</p>

<h3>Toastmasters training helps everyone:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>It helps us give better presentations, even if it is only a request to the boss for a raise.</li>
    <li>It helps to hone our management skills.</li>
    <li>It helps us to work better with fellow employees. Often listening to what they have to say will help your day
        &lsquo;at the office&rsquo; go a little smoother.
    </li>
    <li>You may have invented the better mousetrap. Toastmasters will help you effectively develop and present your
        ideas.
    </li>
    <li>Toastmasters offers constructive feedback, to help you make the changes that lead to better communications.</li>
    <li>Toastmasters will help you to accept criticism more objectively.</li>
    <li>Toastmasters produce results. Around the world, more than three million men and women of all ages and
        occupations have benefited from Toastmasters training, and more than one thousand corporations, community
        groups, universities, associations, and government agencies now use Toastmasters training to enhance their
        communication skills.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="here-are-10-ways-the-club-can-propel-your-career">10 ways Toastmasters can propel your career</h2>

<h3>1. Chance to improve the skill most in demand by employers</h3>

<p>Hiring decision-makers consistently list communication as the No. 1 skill they seek in new hires. The candidates who
    get jobs and get promoted are confident and are the best communicators. Toastmasters members have endless
    opportunities to polish this skill that is so crucial for career advancement.</p>

<p>Members frequently credit Toastmasters with their new jobs and promotions. Others say they&#39;ve developed the
    confidence to take on projects they would not have felt they could handle before Toastmasters. &quot;I am more
    confident in my job speaking at all levels,&quot; says Lisa Ward, a member of Colville Toastmasters in Colville,
    WA.</p>

<h3>2. Opportunity to polish leadership skills</h3>

<p>Communication skills are a huge part of how Toastmasters helps professionals, but they go hand-in-hand with
    leadership skills. Since 2011, Toastmasters has emphasized leadership and developed the tagline, &quot;Where leaders
    are made.&quot;</p>

<p>Toastmasters is known for its well-organized and engaging meetings. They get that way through strong leadership.
    Members sharpen and practice leadership skills by running engaging meetings and special events.</p>

<h3>3. Practice thinking on your feet</h3>

<p>The comedian George Jessel once said: &quot;The human brain starts working the moment you are born and never stops
    until you stand up to speak in public.&quot; Most of us have had the terrifying experience of freezing up when asked
    to speak unexpectedly. In addition to delivering prepared speeches, Toastmasters members attain experience in
    impromptu speaking during a regular meeting component called &quot;Table Topics,&quot; in which they speak for 1-2
    minutes on a subject for which they&#39;ve had no advance preparation.</p>

<p>In the workplace, the rewards of learning to speak on your feet are tremendous. You may be called upon to speak to
    your boss, the media, customers, and other audiences with little previous notice. Developing your ability to speak
    eloquently off the cuff means you&#39;re ready to talk about anything and respond quickly to questions instead of
    having your mind go blank.</p>

<p>And speaking of questions, can you imagine how practice in thinking and speaking on your feet can benefit you in a
    job interview?</p>

<h3>4. Experience in running time-efficient meetings</h3>

<p>You have probably been in meetings that dragged on and on and went way over their allotted time. That doesn&#39;t
    happen in Toastmasters. Toastmasters clubs meet for a set amount of time -- often an hour -- and are committed to
    staying within that timeframe.</p>

<p>&quot;Toastmasters has shown me how to keep a meeting on task,&quot; says Colville Toastmasters founder Troy
    Anderson, &quot;so that everyone comes away without feeling frustrated from spending a lot of time and yet not
    making any headway.&quot; Linda Evans, also of the Colville club, says, &quot;I like that the meetings are so
    organized and only an hour long.&quot;</p>

<h3>5. Even more skills and resume items</h3>

<p>Beyond communication and leadership skills, the Toastmasters program specifically targets listening, critical
    thinking, giving feedback, time management, planning and implementation, organization and delegation, facilitation,
    mentoring, motivation, and team-building.</p>

<p>Toastmasters members can choose to undertake projects such as mounting publicity and membership campaigns, planning
    training programs, organizing special events, and serving as a top officer in a district comprising thousands of
    members.</p>

<h3>6. Attention from employers who recognize the value of Toastmasters</h3>

<p>&quot;There are several types of experience that always make me take notice of a candidate,&quot; says webinar
    specialist Susan Black (Niven). &quot;One is Toastmasters. Why Toastmasters? Because the communication, teamwork,
    leadership, and feedback skills that every member in every club learns are all-important in virtually any job. But
    probably the most important thing, for me, is the self-confidence that Toastmasters build along the way, and which
    affects every aspect of their lives,&quot; says Niven, who has served in volunteer leadership positions from the
    club level through to the Board of Directors of Toastmasters International.</p>

<p>As evidence of employers that recognize Toastmasters&#39; value, more than 3,000 organizations, including the Walt
    Disney Company, The Coca-Cola Company, and Apple Computer, sponsor in-house Toastmasters clubs as communication
    training for employees.</p>

<h3>7. A way to legitimately characterize employment gaps constructively</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve always advised job seekers to try to account productively for time between jobs. Sometimes, however,
    candidates aren&#39;t very convincing in describing vague &quot;consulting&quot; or &quot;project&quot; work. Active
    Toastmasters members don&#39;t have that problem.</p>

<p>&quot;I had been unemployed for a year and a half at the height of the economic downturn,&quot; recalls Linda
    Eenigenburg, a metrics analyst at Aon Hewitt, Chicago. During an interview, both hiring managers, Eenigenburg says,
    were concerned about this gap and asked her what she had been doing during that time. Without hesitation, she
    described her extensive activities in Toastmasters International the past few years. &quot;I was hired within 24
    hours,&quot; she says.</p>

<h3>8. An inexpensive training and professional-development program</h3>

<p>In most organizations, budgets for training and professional development were among the first line items slashed in
    the economic downturn. You might be willing to invest money out of pocket for such programs, but if you were to
    search on the Internet for programs that teach you communication, public speaking, and leadership skills, you&#39;d
    be looking to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in most cases.</p>

<p>In contrast, the dues a member pays to belong to Toastmasters can be as low as $1.77 weekly. Your employer might even
    be willing to sponsor your membership.</p>

<p>In Toastmasters, members have the opportunity to work toward educational goals, following a communication track and a
    leadership track. The ultimate education award is Distinguished Toastmaster, which brings together both tracks. The
    self-paced Toastmasters program proceeds in a logical sequence that helps members build skills with every speech
    they give or leadership role they perform.</p>

<p>&quot;If an individual has served in any of the volunteer leadership positions in the organization [through the
    various levels of Toastmaster],&quot; Niven says, &quot;that individual has learned and applied amazing leadership
    and team-building skills. As with every part of the Toastmasters International program, they have been provided with
    excellent training for every role, and with guidance and mentoring from others.&quot;<a

            style="color:#0000ff;">&nbsp;Learn more about Toastmasters educational programs.</span></a></p>

<h3>9. Excellent networking opportunity</h3>

<p>Toastmasters provides a fun yet constructive way to network with others who may become your career contacts. Heather
    O&#39;Neill describes a Toastmasters networking experience &quot;beyond all expectations&quot; in&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.toastmasters.org/ToastmastersMagazine/ToastmasterArchive/2010/May/Networking-Secrets.aspx"
            rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">an article in&nbsp;<i>Toastmaster</i>&nbsp;magazine</span></a>.
</p>

<h3>10. Regular reinforcement of learning</h3>

<p>As the Toastmasters brochure, Clear Communication points out, &quot;When employees attend seminars, they quickly
    forget what they learned; when they regularly attend Toastmasters meetings, they learn skills that stay with them
    for a lifetime.&quot; Toastmasters clubs meet at least monthly, with many meetings weekly or twice a month, so
    members continue to practice and develop skills.</p>
