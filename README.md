# Cyberjaya_Community_Toastmasters_Club_website
Source codes for Cyberjaya Toastmasters website which includes automation for the next meeting date &amp; Zoom login details.

The code displays the date for the next meeting and the Zoom details on the day after the meeting day at 12:00 AM. The club meets in 1st & 3rd Wednesday.
The date is printed and the Zoom details are stored in array which is inefficient. I am looking for ways to code the formula for 1st & 3rd Wednesdays. 
So, feel free to fork the repo to improve the code and create a pull request.
